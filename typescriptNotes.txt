Why Typescript ?

->Typescript is a superset of JS, which means a .ts file can have javascript code in it
->It gives you static typing (just like in cpp, int x = 10; x = "hello" will give error. Typescript will give error as well but JS wont)
->Makes your code more strict



Typescript does not run the code

We know how Js runs the code, it goes line by line and registers each function and only goes inside the functions if called
Typescripts only job is to compile the .ts code and make sure there is no indentation, syntax issue, no type issues and converts the .ts code to .js code

Typescript throws COMPILATION ERRORS and javascript throws RUNTIME ERRORS


Interfaces : 

-> Interfaces lets you accumulate data of a specific type
-> Interfaces can use other Interfaces
-> Interfaces can extend other Interfaces
-> Interfaces can be implemented by classes


Types : 

-> very slightly different from Interfaces
-> Need to be equated
-> Very useful for unions and ors
-> Can not be extended
-> types cant be implemented by classes
-> types can use other interfaces or types but cant extend other interfaces or types
-> types can do unions and intersections like type Shape = Circle | Square | Rectangle | Pentagon or  type Shape = Circle & Square & Rectangle (means saare interfaces ke unique fields ka cummulation)
